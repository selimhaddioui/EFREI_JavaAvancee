# Fourth part  

* Create *src\site\site.xml* then analyze site.xml content.

  If we just created it then *site.xml* should be empty, but it does not make sense so we took *site.xml* template from maven documentation. This *site.xml* describe how our site is. See [site.xml](https://github.com/selimhaddioui/EFREI_JavaAvancee/commit/fb06933b283c3987492adb3fb101256ee7afe095#diff-9c59bd8d6e464486ca6f124760b6d67235cd96f5c5a0186317c65da34aeb54e3).  

* Again, launch `mvn site`.

* Analyze *target\site* content.

  It look the same way as before but when we look last edit date we see that they just have been updated. See [commit](https://github.com/selimhaddioui/EFREI_JavaAvancee/commit/2879d2e593a56071148ea94523b50a80c337daac).  

* Open *index.html* and explain how *site.xml* is related to the html files.  

  Our *site.xml* describe exactly what the site contain, we can see that there is a menu called "Maven 2.0" that have the same name as describe in *site.xml* and that contain the same link listed in it.

* Add a new section to left panel.
